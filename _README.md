# Prerequisite

Pip install pyautogui and keyboard

# Intuition
Faced some trouble locating the centre,
im guessing the *centre* is the centre of website without title image
so title image is 34.75px high in my computer, with 13px margin

Less edge will give a higher accuratcy rating

# What it do

Draw a "perfect" circle, aimed for [Neal.fun's perfect circle drawer](https://neal.fun/perfect-circle/)
Inspired by [This Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKac2LAQ2Wg&ab_channel=Cat)

# How to use

1. run code
2. place your cursor at centre, press Q
3. screeenshot, record video, flex however you want.
4. remember to press esc to leave

# Why a triangle is a perfect circle?
the website works by taking points on your moving path, then measure their distance from centre
but my cursor moves tooo fast, so they only can get 3 points,
as the coordinates are already calculated, all three points are perfect
thus they take it as perfect
(Sorry for being bad at explaining)
